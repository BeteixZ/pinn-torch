# Logistic Equation
## Intro
Let  𝐾  represent the carrying capacity for a particular organism in a given environment, and let  𝑟  be a real number that represents the growth rate. The function  𝑃(𝑡)  represents the population of this organism as a function of time  𝑡 , and the constant  𝑃_0  represents the initial population (population of the organism at time  𝑡=0 ). Then the logistic differential equation is

## Boundary Conditions
P(0) = 1
