# Burgers' Equation 
## Intro
This equation describes the movement of a viscous fluid with one spatial (x) and one temporal (t) dimension like a thin ideal pipe with fluid running through it. it describes the speed of fluid at each location along the pipe as time progresses
```math
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} - \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = 0
```
## Data Prepration
The boundary condition was taken to be 
```math
\begin{aligned}
u &= 0  @ x &= 1\\
u &= 0  @ x &= -1\\
u &= 0  @ t &= 0
\end{aligned}
```
## Parameter Study
<!-- 1. The first test was done using the proposed Number of N_u and N_f but with full batch Adam optimizer and Xavier Normal initialization weights with a lr = 0.001 for 20k epochs

2. The second test was done using full batch L-BFGS and Normal Xavier Uniform initialization after 6899 epochs and the input data was shuffled.

3. The third test has the same conditions to the second test but without shuffling the input data after 4763 epochs
